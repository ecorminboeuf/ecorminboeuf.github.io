I am a PhD fellow at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, advised by [Stefano Paesani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u41vIV0AAAAJ&hl=it) and [Peter Lodahl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JfKjRdUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My research focuses on photonic nonlinear operations with quantum emitters.

I did my BSc and MSc in Physics at [ETH Zurich](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/), focusing on quantum information and quantum optics. For my master's thesis, I was a visiting research student with [Ryan Hamerly](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PUUW6h4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Dirk Englund](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ZFpENKoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) at [MIT](https://qp.mit.edu/).  
Prior to that, I did a semester project on trapped ions with Cornelius Hempel and Jonathan Home in the [ETH-PSI Quantum Hub](https://www.psi.ch/en/lnq/qchub). After my BSc, I took a year off studying and worked on laboratory automation for plasmonics experiments as a research assistant at [Polariton Technologies](https://www.polariton.ch/) and Jürg Leuthold's [research group](https://ief.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zürich.

Apart from quantum things, I am also passionate about earth observation and remote sensing. Parallel to and after my MSc degree, I worked as an atmospheric scientist at [Orbio Earth (YC S23)](https://www.orbio.earth/), where I developed techniques to monitor anomalous methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure using satellite data.
