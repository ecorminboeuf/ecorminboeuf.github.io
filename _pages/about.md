I am a PhD fellow at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, advised by [Stefano Paesani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u41vIV0AAAAJ&hl=it) and [Peter Lodahl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JfKjRdUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My research focuses on photonic nonlinear operations with quantum emitters.

I did my BSc and MSc in Physics at ETH Zurich. At some points before starting my PhD, I was also a visiting research student with Ryan Hamerly and Dirk Englund at [MIT](https://qp.mit.edu/), a research assistant at [Polariton Technologies](https://www.polariton.ch/) and an atmospheric scientist at [Orbio Earth (YC S23)](https://www.orbio.earth/).
