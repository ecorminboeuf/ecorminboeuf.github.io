## Introduction to Quantum Information Science

I TA'd for Klaus MÃ¸lmer's Intro to QIS course in the fall 25. For that course, we created example solutions for Scott Aaronsons course with the same name. You can find them [here](https://tenor.com/view/rickroll-roll-rick-never-gonna-give-you-up-never-gonna-gif-22954713).


## Computer Science

During my BSc at ETH Zurich, I taught a few introductory computer science courses for Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering Students. The courses mainly focused on introducing students to programming and teaching them the basics of c++, in the hopes that this then later generalises well to learning other programming languages.
